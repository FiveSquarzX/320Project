This is a summary of stuff I (Brooke) have done so far, just so we don't accidentally do the same thing twice.

# Focus
Currently planning on inspecting trends between differences in sell price/showroom price and owner types.

# Plots
Made general scatter plot visualizing showroom vs sell prices with available showroom data.
