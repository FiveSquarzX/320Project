This is a summary of stuff I (Brooke) have done so far, just so we don't accidentally do the same thing twice.

# Focus
Currently planning on inspecting trends between differences in sell price/showroom price and owner types.

# Plots
- General scatter plot visualizing showroom vs sell prices with available showroom data.
- Scatter plot visualizing showroom vs sell prices colored by year (pre or post 2014)

# Analyses
- Two sided independent t-test on difference between showroom and sell price based on year (pre or post 2014)
- Results suggest year is unlikely to not impact this difference
